# DivHacks
## Overview
`DivHacks` is a web application project created for DivHacks, Columbia University's annual hackathon. It informs people on the ways in which poor waste management detriments the earth and how people can live more sustainably by properly reusing, recycling, and reducing waste.

## Structure
The web application includes:
* Information on waste reduction and why it matters
* An interactive game that teaches children whether to sort common objects into recycling, compost or trash
* A list of helpful links on recyling and composting
